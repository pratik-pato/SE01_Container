Read the "note-about-credit.txt" carefully.

You may fetch a very large negative credit (including potential disqualification from the entire course also) if you submit an assignment without checking it yourself that it works as expected for the conditions given in the assignment text. Read the assignment text very carefully before you submit the assignment solution. Submitting junk code that obviously doesn't work as expected in the name of assignment work will be dealt with in a very strict manner. Do not submit the program, if it does NOT conform the given specifications.

As discussed in the class, you have to implement a HTML and JS based program that allows the users to load, edit, create a DAG representing type hierarchy.

User should be able
 - to construct/add new types by entering text in the textbox labeled `add/edit type` 
   and by pressing the [Enter] key; [after the [Enter] key is pressed, the most recently
   entered type in the list should be selected automatically for further processing]

 - to select a type just by pressing up/down/home/end keys; up/down keys should move 
   selection by 1 entry at a time while home/end keys should move selection to start/end
   respectively

 - to add/remove all types to/from selection by pressing [Enter]
       Note that the [Enter] key event should be handled separately depending 
       upon whether it happened while editing the type name or while selecting types.

 - to delete selected type(s) by pressing [Delete] key - all the selected types 
   should be deleted

 - to edit a selected type by pressing [Insert] key - the top-most selected type should 
   be brought in the editable textbox labeled `add/edit type` and further keystrokes
   (especially the arrow, delete, spacebar keys) should be processed accordingly;
      the [Enter] key press should terminate the editing by adding/saving the entry 
      to the list while the [Esc] key press should terminate the editing by discarding 
      the changes and in case of discard the focus/cursor should remain in the textbox only
 
 - to select a type for subtype creation by pressing [Right] arrow key
 
 - to add/remove a type to/from the already selected list of super-types by pressing the
   [Spacebar] key

 - to finish creation of sub type edit by pressing [Left] arrow key or by pressing the
   [Enter] key; to abort creation/editing of sub type by pressing [Esc] key
 
 - to create DAG by pressing [F2] key while not editing type name
 
 - to load DAG by pressing [F3] key while not editing type name

You may wish to refer [jqdoc] to see how to handle keyboard events.

Your program should prevent the user from
 - creating wrong/invalid type hierarchy
 - entering invalid type names [type names should start with alphabet, and 
   can contain only alphabets, numerals and the dash character, type name 
   length should not exceed 20 characters]
